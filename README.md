# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## 1.	Overview of Project

The focal point of this analysis is to comprehend the performance of “Theatre”, if there are any correlations thru the 12 months of the year and obtain the period with the most success to achieve the financial objective.
In a more specific way, it’s necessary to gather analysis inside the theatre, subgenre “Plays” to visualize different ranges of objectives and their respective index of success and choose the most adequate range.

## 2.	Analysis and Challenges

In the graph is clear to see the best month for launching a founding are May to July, but it was impossible to see the changes in tendencies because of the lack of Year Ago info or the last 2 years.
One solution is to filter the graph by year, then analyze the median of all years, so we can contrast the last 2 years, in this way we can obtain the tendency and get a correct insight.

In this graph the display of the years persists, so we can’t visualize by year. This presents the same complexity as the previous graph. The insight we obtain was 2 different ranges with 60-80% of success index. 
To bring a solution we need to visualize by year or range of years, but it is also recommended to look for the difference between the plays that are in the range <5K and the ones between 35K to 45K

## 3.	Results

The best season to launch theatre funding campaign is Summer.
Historically the worst months to reach funds are November and December.
The output of the analysis is if you have a well develop play, you must ask for the range between 35K to 45K.

The last recommendation to analyze the vast numeric information of high value is necessary to visualize not just the graphs but also tables, as the cut by years or range by years. It’s important to analyze all the spectrums of the data. You must see the range of the founding most successful, then the number of people who donated, then obtain the average of donations by people. This can help you to understand the common factor of this plays with index of success and specific range of donations,
